# StackOverflowDevsList
Frontend application with two pages. First page shows a list with the developers from StackOverflow (profile picture + name). 
When you click on one of the list element, a new window appears, showing infos about the selected developer from the list.

# ---------------------

For the data about the stackoverflow users I used https://api.stackexchange.com/docs as API refrences

# ---------------------

The javascript operations are to sort the list by name and filter it.
The filter uses an input, where when you add characters, the list will dinamically change 
and will show just the users that have in their names the added characters.

# ---------------------

The list overalll is dinamically generated in java script file. 
The caching is realised with localStorage
